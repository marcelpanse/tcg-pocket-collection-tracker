# TCG Pocket Collection Tracker

TCG Pocket Collection Tracker is an application designed to help users efficiently track their Pok√©mon Pocket game cards, identify optimal card packs to open, manage trades, and engage with both friends and the community at large. Our application is completely free, open-source, and prioritizes user privacy by not selling data, tracking analytics, using advertisements, or accepting donations.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
The frontend is built as a static HTML site, powered by React and TypeScript. We utilize Vite to compile it into a standalone application, which is hosted cost-free on GitHub Pages. The UI leverages ShadCN and Tailwind CSS, while react-table is employed for handling extensive card lists, supported by react-virtualize for efficient data virtualization.

### Backend
Our backend infrastructure utilizes Appwrite.io, an open-source alternative to Firebase or Supabase, with robust features including a free tier supporting up to 75,000 monthly active users. The backend manages user authentication (via OTP email) and includes a database for card storage.
